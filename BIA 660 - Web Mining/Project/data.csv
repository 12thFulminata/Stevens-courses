0,4,"The paella was delicious, my only comment is that the muscles were basically disintegrated. The pork in the el Classico Plato was tender and juicy Would pass on the white sangria, a half pitcher filled two glasses up to the top."
1,4,Excellent food. Highly recommend the Mar Y Tierra (hangar steak) and Ropa Vieja (braised skirt steak).
2,5,"It had been a while since I've been back to Hoboken so I was glad to be back.  I decided to stop for a drink at this place because my wife heard some good music coming from inside.  We were sure glad we did.  This spot was fun!  Carlos the bartender and Sandra the manager were fantastic hosts.  They told us stories that had us laughing so hard they left me in tears.   Carlos made me a drink that was outstanding.  A cucumber spicy margarita, however after drinking it, I decided to eat the pepper and it was hotter than $&amp;@!  Sandra made me an antidote that thank the lord cooled me down.  Since we had just eaten before entering this place we weren't going to eat but the food looked so good we decided to try a couple of apps.  The empanadas and the guac served with thinly sliced tostones were delicious.  I get the feeling dinner will be fantastic.  I will be back!  The only negative I have to say about this place is that the if you have to go to the bathroom after having a few drinks you could end up impaled by the stairs you have to climb.  Lol!"
3,4,"This Cuban restaurant is a surprise at the beginning-they have outside seating and as you enter it seems small with 2 or 4 table seating and the bar loved how quaint the atmosphere was. As you head to the bathroom upstairs they have more seatings with a large Cuban sign a step down more seating then you go slightly up the stairs and more seating. I was truly amazed how accommodating the restaurant was. But we sat at the bar and Carlos the bartender (funny guy) made us a delicious margarita drink then he told us about this jalapeño infused tequila drink he makes and that was one of the best drinks I have ever had. Carlos also made me a grape fruit spicy drink with tequila as well sooo good. We then meet Sandra the manager what a beautiful lady (mind you when we got to the bar it was early). We had the pleasure of having a fun time with much needed laughter and conversations, thank you Carlos and Sandra for making us feel very special. We didn't eat dinner but we had appetizers the empanadas were very good and their guacamole with plantain chips amazing. We will definitely be going back for dinner see you soon Sandra and Carlos"
4,4,"In addition to the paella which was a bit too hot but in general really tasty once it cooled down, we got spicy margaritas and plantain chips with guacamole at the bar before sitting down to eat. The plantain chips were easily the best we've ever had and are now in search of more plantain chips, and the margaritas were good. While it was a Friday night so it was a bit crowded we did have to wait quite a bit longer than they had originally told us. However the servers were all very friendly, the vibes were great, and we definitely recommend!"
5,4,The food was yummy and flavorful. The service was great and the server recommended a few drinks and it just made the experience better. The ambiance was on relaxed and felt like a perfect date spot.  if you want an enjoyable couple night out this is the place.
6,5,"Food, Service and Ambiance Grace this cherished establishment. Local and trusted. We leave Manhattan for Hoboken a few times a year. One of our first Lunch spots. The action is non-stop with locals, tourists and old family neighbors."
7,1,"I came here two years ago and the food was good and the drinks were good also. However we came today and the paella we ordered was burnt and the seafood was not great excep for the shrimp. The appetizer was good, mussels with chorizo and it was good."
8,4,"Second time visiting here and i enjoyed the food yet again!If i remember right, i got the Churrasco before and it was delicious! This time I tried the Vaca frita and it was flavorful and filling! It was served with white rice and a side of black beans which you can drizzle on (the rice i mean). We got the Caesar salad with chicken on the side and the Pollo Criollo. That Pollo was sooo good! There was really good flavor on the meat and paired with fried rice..mmmm!It is a bit pricey but since we quite enjoyed the food and even the service, we'll let that one slide for now lol"
9,1,"Name is deceptive. The master chef  is Mexican not Cuban. That's not what I wanted from a supposed  CUBAN cuisine. Cuban and Mexican are nothing alike in flavor , condiments or cooking methods. Change the name or the Chef"
10,5,"This place was fantastic. Just to start, showed up to our resy early and they were able to seat us right away. The vibes were amazing and the place had an abundance of seating. From the greeter, to our waiter everyone was so genuinely nice. On to the food...we got the guacamole and plantain chips, OMG. So good and FRESH. Our main courses consisted of skirt steak and slow cooked shredded skirt steak. The meat was cooked perfect and soooooo full of flavor. The price was reasonable for the servings. I def recommend."
11,1,"Went there yesterday, April 1st aka April Fools day. So I assumed the nasty service must have been a prank. But no, it was for real. My family and I sat outside around 6pm, it was a gorgeous evening. I arrived first as my group was parking. A middle aged lady with long hair walks up to my table and very loudly tells me ""When it rains you can't come inside! You have to take your food to go!"". Everyone at the other tables stopped talking as they were shocked too. I said ""well that's a warm welcome"". She repeated it again. I thought she must be joking. She was not. Then my family walk up and see my shocked face and they sat down wondering what just transpired. A waiter brought us water &amp; I asked him to please NOT send the lady to us again. Then an older waiter came and he was very kind but seemed overwhelmed and frazzled. At least HE was friendly. The wait was very long for sautéed Spinach, which is the only thing I ordered. My adult daughter had the black beans and plantains (they looked very oily) and my 10 year old had the wings. We were almost done with our food and sure enough it got super windy and it started raining big time. We went inside ONLY to wash our hands and pay. It was SUPER crowded but there were two empty seats at the bar. So we took turns using the bathroom and sat there to pay. The owner came up to me and shouted at me that my ""kid can't sit at the bar!"" as he pointed right at my kids face. I said ""we are leaving; just want to pay and wash our hands; waiting for my daughter and we are leaving. He repeated himself again sternly (it was hard to hear him over the SUPER LOUD Cyndi Lauper music ""girls just wanna have fun"".. told him to calm down and that he should maybe be friendlier to his guests AND play some CUBAN MUSIC, not 80's American POP!. You see, they use false advertising; outside they play Cuban music to lure people in; once you come in, the music doesn't match the restaurant. The overpriced Food was just a tad better than the crappy treatment. Never going back!Like"
12,5,This was by far the best skirt steak I've had at a Latinx restaurant. It was cooked to requested perfection. The meat was tender but perfectly grilled. The chimichurri sauce was perfectly balanced. At first I was disappointed that there were no substitutions allowed but I didn't care a single bit after I ate the dish. The fried rice with chicken was also fantastic and creative. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!! PS- parking is hard in Hoboken so plan accordingly.
13,5,"The food is delicious and so are the drinks! I have enjoyed the churrasco and their mojitos. It is a bit pricey so it's definitely a treat for us to go. The staff is kind and attentive. I love the vibe of the place! It's a great date night spot, very romantic depending on where you sit in the restaurant. It's also massive!"
14,5,"Cuban Restaurant is located in the busy Washington Avenue in Hoboken and is an excellent find in the busy area. Great food, great drinks, great service in a oddly shaped three floor restaurant. Cool ambiance, fun decor and clean well kept eating area. Fair warning - the restaurant had three levels and the bathrooms are on the top floor so anyone with mobility issues will have a challenge."
15,5,I came for dinner with no reservations on a Thursday and was seated quickly. The waiter was really welcoming and nice. The service was quick too. We had mojitos and they were delicious! I think it was passion fruit flavor. We were really hungry so we tried the beef empanadas and we ate them so quickly. They had the perfect flavor and cook. We received our entrees not too long after we finished the empanadas which was great. I've had the Churrasco the last time I came but did not like it so much so I decided to have the chicken. It was a great choice along with the rice and beans. My friend had the Grilled Hanger Steak and enjoyed it too. It may have a different taste from the Churrasco. The only downside is how far the bathroom is. You need to walk up several flights. Overall it was a great dinner though!
16,4,"The staff here are very friendly and accommodating. I changed my decision of sitting outside to inside and there was no issue. The place was very nice and there weren't many people, maybe because it was a week day. We were catered to quickly and we got guacamole for our appetizer. It was really good. I've never had it with plantain chips and it was a great touch. For my entree I got the churrasco cubano, which is the skirt steak with chimichurri sauce. It came in a normal time. I asked for medium cook but it tasted like well done at first. I told the waiter about it and he nicely said that sometimes the ends are more cooked and to taste the middle. It was medium in the middle. After this it tasted really good. The fries were good too. It wasn't the best I've had but did the job. The tres leches on the other hand was really tasty. I usually don't eat tres leches but I decided to try it and I'm glad I did!"
17,5,This is one of my favorite restaurants.   Food is always delicious.  Had dinner there with my sister and brother-in-law and Sandra our Waitress made me a frozen coconut margarita and My sister and Steve frozen Pina coladas and they were delicious. We will definitely get them again.  Thank you Sandra.My family have celebrated 3 birthday dinners there and the service is always great.
18,4,"Can't believe it took me a year and a half to get here! I love some other Cuban restaurants in Hoboken/Jersey City so I was very excited to finally try it. We made a reservation for dinner on Resy. I'd recommend as it was full when we arrived! We ordered a pitch of the sangria to start. What a great deal! It pours about 4 glasses which was perfect for us. The fruit is so fresh, it really feels like you're on a vacation. And we had to get the empanadas. We both the cheese and the beef. Beef were the better of the two!  For dinner we had a Cuban sandwich and Camaron Al Ajillo. Everything was incredible. Service was great and it's no time at all for your food to arrive. Really looking forward to going back again soon."
19,1,We walked in was seated immediately restaurant was fairly empty. Everything seemed fine ...after intentionally waiting to observe what was going on which was nothing !employees  standing around the bar gossiping we decided we'd had enough and got up to leave  as we were leaving the bartender says thank you for coming have a great day! what a joke we were seated in the bar area and Not one person ask us if we wanted a drink more less a glass of water. People also beware the bathroom is  literally 2 steep floors upstairs . Zero elevator for even the disabled. I ask they claim there was none. We will NEVER come to this establishment again what a disgrace.
20,5,"I'm so thankful that The Cuban Restaurant was open on Xmas; otherwise, we would have gotten some food from a food truck....and I'm NOT a fan of knish or Kabob. For it to have been a holiday, it had a pretty nice size crowd. The food was on point. The vaca frita was nice and crispy... I loved the maduros ( I never had any that I didn't like). The rice and beans  weren't dry. There is plenty of food on the plate! Hubby ordered me a side of yucca and mojo... which I couldn't devour like I wanted - tummy was full! They have a variety of drinks cocktails wine beer and non alcoholic drinks.This restaurant was a nice save. I loved it!!! Nice little Latin vibe going on and floors for dining..cozy, and the staff is so super friendly. Festive atmosphere.  I got the tres leche cake to go....Yummy deliciousness"
21,4,"I would normally give this place a 5 star, service is great and food as well. The bartender makes a mean cucumber spicy marg, but!As someone who was a regular before the pandemic, I was addicted to the pan de yuca they would serve.I miss it so much! No one in the county serves them and it's a pain to make it at home so the Cuban was a perfect place to satisfy that craving! Please bring it back! It was a staple! I'll pay whatever the price is but bring it back!"
22,4,"Amazing spot in Hoboken! Came to the Cuban for a birthday brunch this past Saturday. Blown away by how great everything turned out. We were seated outside in the shade, which was definitely the vibe. Inside is definitely more of a dinner, dim light ambiance, also great for a date night. I ordered the omelette with vegetables and cheese and a side of yuca fries. Tasted so fresh and delicious. On top of everything, the servers were so accommodating. Would highly recommend"
23,3,"I did like the vibe of the restaurant and the people were super friendly and accommodating. But be prepared to wait a long time for your food and drinks. Our reservation was for 8pm. Drinks came at 8:30, app and 8:53 and entree at 9:30 and dessert at 10. For what we ordered, I don't think it should have taken that long to prepare each item. Also the food though good wasn't great to wait that long for it. The dessert was really good though. I wouldn't come back because of the wait time and because I can get better Cuban food elsewhere."
24,5,"This is my first time at The Cuban and it was an amazing experience.  Sandra, the bartender made us really tasty drinks but the highlight of the night is when she told us they had Whole Fried Snapper. The fish was presented beautifully and was delicious.  My husband calls Sandra family. Great Customer Serve Sis!!!"
25,5,Great food and great atmosphere. Service is the best. Everyone there is so happy. The bathroom is very clean!!! Highly recommended!
26,4,"I have been coming to The Cuban for many years. I'll admit it's my guilty sin after the gym, or if I need a happy hour break during the week or if a lazy weekend is in order! The servers are great! It's truly one of my happy places. Sandra, Gio or Lorenzo really know how to take care of their guests. I always feel like a special guest coming here. They know my name and my order. I posted four stars because I learned today that the cheesy cassava bread will be discontinued next month. That makes me sad because- like many I  have a gluten allergy. I hope that this is reconsidered and stays on the menu! It's delicious and one of my favorites."
27,3,"It was good food and pricey but was worth it, the server tried so hard for us to drink alcohol beverages had no consideration that we were driving home all he thought about was making his check bigger for a bigger tip"
28,5,"I love Hoboken, I just never go because parking is always a nightmare. But I was determined to have brunch and I'm glad I went!For my appetizer I had the best garlic shrimp I think I've ever had, with nice crispy crostini for dunking. Then for lunch the ceasar salad with chicken, which was healthy &amp;&amp; delicious! I will be back for dinner."
29,5,"I love the Cuban! This is my fifth time here and I highly suggest to give this place a try.  Make sure you call to make a reservation, due to the pandemic and its limited capacity, they get pretty booked.  I made the mistake of not making a reservation but I'm glad I only had to wait 30min, it could've longer.   Let's go back to the food... DELICIOUS! We had ceviche with watermelon and some delicious salmon as well... I had tres leches cake for dessert which is MUST ya'll! Try to get the yuca fries if they're available, you'll remember me. The staff was amazing, they were patient, kind, and super funny.  They made this experience a great one!"
30,2,"Got the empanada trio (kinda bland), churrasco and el clasico. Was tasty but got food poisoning, not going back."
31,5,Came here for happy hour on A Friday after work. The ambiance is perfect for a date night. The empanadas were delicious. The bartender offered hot sauce that matched perfectly. My drink was similar to a Paloma and it tasted delicious.
32,5,"2nd time dining at this location. This time for Valentines weekend. Walked into a full house and the atmosphere was everything. Live music bumping, couples and families were all having a great time. As usual, the food was amazing with no complaints. Nothing bad to say at all."
33,3,"Recently we ate at the Cuban bar and restaurant in Hoboken, NJ. The food was good but the prices were outrageous. We had a party of five, and didn't order anything out of the ordinary two appetizers and five entrees, soda( they charged $3.50 per soda refill) and two drinks, when all was said and done the check came out $331 dollars, $57 of the $331 was included gratuity on the bill, in addition to another $25 dollar surcharge. I am from Miami and at any decent Cuban restaurant you pay no more than $20.00 on churrasco, $15.00 on pollo a la parilla, or Ropa vieja. We were shocked, and will never return there again."
34,5,"We had the avocado crab appetizer, ropa vieja, and skirt steak. Everything was fresh and delicious. If I'm ever in Hoboken again I would revisit this restaurant.  #Crab Guacamole #Skirt Steak#Ropa Vieja Plato"
35,5,"Thank you Yelp for this suggestion. This was honestly so great. We were able to call and request a table for 4 people 30 mins in advance. Once we arrived, we were seated right away. Initially when we arrived, all tables were social distanced. 3 levels in the back of tables. One additional section in the front. Decor is very pretty. Temperature not checked. Passion fruit mojito is a MUST. The paella Valencia was amazing. I could do without the garlic aioli. Ask for the spicy green sauce on the side to add. Towards leaving, the bottom level (lounge area) started to get to crowded fir my liking."
36,5,"Great place! I ordered the Ropa Vieja and it was delicious. I also have an extremely uncommon allergy, and our server was incredibly attentive for me and double checked everything. I felt entirely safe! My friends ordered the El Clásico and the Quinoa de Végétales. We also shared the Guacamole. Everything was delicious! It was a bit on the mid-pricier side but all of the plates were huge! Overall, the place has a great vibe which would be perfect for a date or girls night!"
37,1,"If I could give them less than 1 star I would!  Terrible, terrible service.  Not worth the $250 (what a joke!)!  I'm Latin &amp; the food was not great.  Our kids attend college in Hoboken so we went based on reviews. The server (who we later find out is also the Manager) was absolutely terrible.  We ordered 3 appys &amp; they only gave us 2.  I ask her &amp; she's oblivious to this.  Our son orders a ginger ale that we never get &amp; I have to ask her for it &amp; it arrives 1/2 hr later.  My husband's steak (which was ordered medium well) arrived raw &amp; cold.  The waitress was not attentive to our table.  My husband ordered a martini which took forever to get.  We noticed the bartender touching his nose before getting the olives for the martini.  I call consistently to complain about the service and I speak to a lady who informs me that our waitress was the Manager.  She tells me that she will speak to the owner because this is not the 1st time people have complained about her &amp; nothing happens to rectify the problem because she consistently intervenes the complaints &amp; the owner is oblivious.  This is terrible!!!  We will never go there again &amp; I would NEVER recommend this place!!!  Absolutely horrible!!!"
38,3,"Unfortunately the experience did not live upto expectations. The drinks were ok, nothing spectacular or unique and the mojitos we felt weren't very good. The food was also ok, the empanadas (beef) were our favorite part of the meal, the grilled chicken was pretty good but the white rice was sticky and had a distinct flavor; the ropa vieja was not good, it was like tossed in tomato paste, not like any we've had before. Our waiter was rushing often with us, which didn't make us feel comfortable or welcomed to order with grace. I am giving 3 stars because of the pandemic and circumstances for all are hard but I would even give 2 with our experience."
39,5,"I had a wonderful evening dining at The Cuban, the waiter Angel was an amazing server. The food was good to the taste. Nice place to dine in :)"
40,5,"My wife and me came here for a date night and were really impressed. The food was really good. I had the Vaca Frita which came with rice, black beans, and avocado. My wife had the hanger steak which was cooked to perfection (she got it medium) and the shrimp, she switched the creamed spinach for asparagus. Plus, we got a side of maduros. Everything was cooked and flavored really good, the portions were generous. The ambiance is really cool here, you walk in and it seems really small but walk pass the kitchen and it opens up with a lot more seating. The bathrooms are located up two flights of stairs though so be aware of that. For drinks we had a coconut mojito which was delicious and strong enough! And a half of pitcher of the red sangria which wasn't our favorite as it's definitely not sweet, mostly tastes like red wine with a splash of fruit... so you decide if that's what you're hoping for. However, the real winner here was the customer service. All the waiters were super attentive, they noticed every detail, and it was some of the best customer service we've had!"
41,3,"We were seated without having to wait, and the staff was very friendly. Customers are supposed to order at least one appetizer per table, and one entree per person. . We both agreed the virgin Pina Coladas weren't great...they were too ""thick"". I don't usually return food, but the Pollo al a Parrilla had such a fishy taste. I've never had this problem, so I don't feel it was the seasoning. The waiter said something may have gotten in the marinade, and offered the chicken empanadas instead. They were much better, and the rice, beans and maduros were great. The portion sizes were large as well. Overall, a good but not great experience."
42,3,"I haven't been to the Cuban in at least 8 years, so my boyfriend and I decided to have dinner there on a Tuesday night.  We were a bit skeptical about going since the yelp reviews feel a bit bipolar.    We didn't have a reservation but it wasn't crowded outdoors and there were several tables open.  When we arrived, I was very turned off by the sign on their door that states outdoor diners must order one starter and one entrée per person.  We were planning to have a regular dinner anyways, however,  I'm curious how strictly they enforce their rule.  You would think they'd want the business from people who might only want a meal &amp; a drink, especially on a night like last night when its not crowed.  For drinks, we each tried different cocktails.  I had the Washington Ave - the grapefruit flavor was refreshing and I liked it a lot.  My bf had the Vodka Ponche - reminded me of a drink I'd have at a beach resort - very tasty but very sweet.  To start, we shared the Camaron Al Ajillo (garlic shrimp) - came with 6 average sized shrimp and two pieces of toast for $15.  Was fine - nothing special, maybe a little skimpy.  For our entrees, I had the El Clásico - the pork was very tender; could have used a little more seasoning.  Came with a gigantic side of moro rice w/ beans.  Entrée was a decent size.  My boyfriend had the Ropa Vieja which came out like a stew with rice.  The meat was tender and I liked the sauce.   Instead of black beans, he substituted them for the garlic spinach which wasn't that good.  We also shared a side of sweet plantains which were addicting!  Service was generally good but probably because it wasn't that crowded. Not sure I'll be rushing back any time soon since there are other good Cuban &amp; Latin  places in town that are BYO and more moderately priced."
43,5,"It's been a while since I ce here for their happy hour specials. They definitely had more varieties of food and drinks before the pandemic for happy hour but what they have now isn't bad. I love their Cuban guacamole. It's basically plantain chips instead of tortilla chips but it's super delicious. Their drinks are very well made, especially mojito and spicy margarita."
44,4,"Love the outdoor dining. Get to hear Hoboken's finest nature sounds of cars, people , dogs, and kids. Wonderful sitting on Washington street.  Good is amazing wish the portions were bigger.  Service is always great be back soon"
45,1,Rip offf. Super expensive for nothing. Ordered for pick up recently and I spent 30$ for one meal and it was the same size as a kids portion.
46,5,"Wow, now I understand why this place is always packed like sardines. Great atmosphere, great food and very friendly staff. I had the sandwich cubano and it finally satisfied my craving for it. The bread was a bit too toasted for my taste, it kind of hurt to bite into but the taste made up for it. My fam had empanadas, mofongo, grilled chicken, arroz moro and croquetas. They basically inhaled everything. I would give them 10 stars if I could."
47,4,"This was my first time here and I can say it was a lovely brunch experience. Our waiter was amazing and very attentive and informative, the atmosphere was great and the establishment was much larger than it seems from the front. They have pitchers of sangria at a good price and they're pretty tasty. The brunch menu was limited but I think it gave an okay amount of options. My meal was okay (aguacate con pan) but the French toast my friend had was to die for ! All in all it was a good experience."
48,1,"This place claims to be pet friendly but is not, if you are not white, the waiter is very mean and told us to sit by the street which really scared our dog, white people had dogs in seats not close to the traffic, will never eat at this place."
49,5,"Short family trip to NJ/NY, last dinner of the trip was at The CR &amp; B which was in the neighborhood we were staying in. Mejillones con chorizo was fantastic. Excellent service. Great way to end the trip."
50,3,"My husband and I came here for drinks and appetizers. While my husband was parking, I came in to ask for patio seating. They said I could not sit without him, even when he was LITERALLY walking up to the restaurant (I was pointing at him and said ""he's right there""). I understand it's a technicality issue, but what if it was just me that wanted to sit? Would they have sat me? Anyways, service was slow to start and when we ordered we said ""can we start with these 2 appetizers for now?"" We were told no, that we had to order everything we wanted at once. The food was fine and the drinks were good. However, the shrimp in the shrimp ceviche was WILDLY over cooked."
51,2,"Been to this place years ago and their drinks were always so good , and the menu back than was actually good and the only problem was service , service was terrible . So we decided to give it a second chance after almost 2 years . Sorry to say the drinks are still good but the bartender is extremely confused handling a busy bar and the entire restaurant . The menu got worse and mediocre , nothing special there . The service was terrible than and it's HORRIBLE now , people are not friendly at all and are over the place , there are to many people around and in all honesty no one knows what they are doing . Really sad once it is a nice spot , but honestly the good drinks are not worth the extremely poor service ."
52,2,"Oh man I'm so sad about this place. It has officially gone downhill and I won't be going any more. The food took forever to come out (over 90 min long) and my favorite churrasco was tough as anything. For a $32 plate, I would expect better.. but it's been getting worse and worse. All of our jaws hurt from chewing the rubbery steak. Ugh. Wings were pretty good... the sauces come on the side. The yuca fries and potatoes were good but everything else.... no bueno. Waiter didn't give a sh*t... it was obvious. So sorry Cuban. You were great and I hate to do this during a rough time... but I can't come back. Wishing you nothing but the best."
53,5,Beautiful scenery and restaurant decor! Food was delicious and we were able to share a parrillada between my husband and myself! Staff offered sincere recommendations and were very attentive. Wonderful place to celebrate our wedding anniversary! Highly recommend!
54,4,"I've actually have been here in the past but never got around to a review or forgot to check in and review. Great atmosphere for lunch and dinner. Great drinks (full bar). Outdoor seating if desired (be prepared for everyone walking by to stare at your plate; this is the entire Hoboken and most outdoor seating in Hoboken). You can never go wrong with grilled octopus for appetizer. Churassco for the main (comes w/ yuca fries and salad). In the pass, I've had the ropa vieja (shredded steak, slow cooked) another great dish. Those are the only 2 dishes i can speak for. If you haven't noticed, this place is Spanish cuisine. Go for it! Especially when you get tired of American bar food in Hoboken"
55,5,"Sandra is the best! Customer service is amazing, sweetest bartender here. All of my drinks came out amazing and service was great."
56,1,"Sadly, this review isn't about food but for the horrible service representation by the hostess. She was extremely rude and displayed actionable racism. Not only was I taken back by it but also the guest behind me. I choose to walk away with my family that included a toddler. What a shame.."
57,4,"Came in on the Friday before labor day for happy hour (bar only - I believe it's 4-7 on M-F). For a long weekend, the place was surprisingly packed, at least for happy hour. We were able to grab one seat, and another one about 15 minutes later.Cocktails (which are pretty strong and I appreciate that, especially during HH), sangria, and house wine are $5, and beers are $4. There are also some HH apps at various prices. We ordered a bunch of apps and were pretty stuffed because the portions are pretty much regular-sized. Here's everything we had:Cuban ($7) - this is one of the better Cuban sammies I've had in Hoboken. I thought it would be small, but it was actually a regular-sized sammie.Frita Cubana (mini beef and chorizo burgers - $8) - this was a tad dry and salty, so I wouldn't recommend these. They are filling though, since it comes three per order.Garlic Shrimp ($8) - the flavor was good but then again, I just love garlicCheese/meat plate ($16) - the description on the menu just says daily selection of Artisan Spanish cheese and cured meats with guava marmalade. For the price, I don't think it was worth it at all. Not for the quality, at least. The cheeses tasted like they were from Shop Rite.I would come back for happy hour to try some of their other dishes (just not the meat and cheese plate again). There's about 15 other things to choose from, so their happy menu for both drinks and food is pretty extensive. Too bad it's at the bar only. I feel like they should make it the bar area, since there is some additional seating there. They would probably get a bigger crowd.Tip - see my attached photos for the happy hour menu because nobody posted any pictures of it so I decided to take one for the team and take some photos."
58,5,The server was very attentive and kind. The food and drinks were very good. And the music was not too loud to allow for a private conversation.
59,5,Amazing place. Sandra is the best!!! The spicy margarita and the cuban sandwich is the best.
60,5,The Cuban is by far our favorite place in Hoboken. Paella was always our go to but tonight Sandra (the BEST waitress) recommended the seafood soup and it was awesome. Sandra really made sure we enjoyed our time and the kitchen took care of the rest!
61,4,"Hoboken is the home to a variety of good Cuban places, and this is one of them. The food and selection here is decent, particularly their flexibility and willingness to cater to those V/VEG. The price point here is a little less friendly, as it is on the higher side. With that said, it is a nice place and the ambiance is one of the more unique you will find in Hoboken if you go to the back rooms. From the chicken and sausage fried rice to the variety of steak options they provide, it's a good place to get some unique flavors to your tastebuds if you don't frequent Cuban fare. The flavors are not overwhelming or ""too different"" yet unique and good. The Sangria pitchers provide for fun and are a relative good bang for your Buck. Overall, an above average place, and worth trying for something new if you haven't!"
62,4,"been here twice - but many years apart. the first time, i remember really liking my pork entree. my most recent trip, i had the paella valencia, which came chock full of seafood -- mussels, bay scallops, and shrimps -- as well as chicken and sausage. there wasn't a ton of soccarat, but what was there was crispy and delicious. it's a pretty good sized portion. little cramped in the restaurant, but that's hoboken for ya. service just fine."
63,5,The coconut Mojito was similar to a piña colada very delicious. The red sangria was a perfect blend of fruitiness while also tasting the wine it was superb. Beef empanada was also very fresh and delicious and I especially enjoyed the sauce it came with. The paella was so filling I wasn't able to fill finish it and the muscles and oysters were especially delicious. My boyfriend got the vaca frita which was superb. The Cuban is a must go. Great Covid precautions and the Decour and music really was a great date night spot
64,4,"Great Cuban cuisine with all your traditional dishes  home away from home. Felt like I was in Miami; service was amazing the bar inside and outside. Drinks was on point, cafecito was perfect ambiance was lovely. Definitely recommend anyone to come here if you are in Hoboken."
65,5,Such great service at this spot! Drinks were made perfectly and servers were extremely attentive to me and my table. Their food was stunning and soooo delicious. Everything came out in a very timely manner and was super fresh. A 10/10 and I will definitely be back here. No complaints from me!
66,3,"Inconsistent, have gone 3 times and only the first time was it tasty. The other 2 times the churrasco was overcooked and they told me they couldnt put the dressing on the side for the salad. Their apps: wings and cuban sandwich - not tasty at all. Wouldnt recommend. Their salad is far too oily too. Overall the ambiance is pretty but if you're looking for real cuban food this place isnt it"
67,5,I have been going here for almost every birthday of mine the last 4 years or so. It is such a great place in the area to get great cuban food!
68,4,"Service was fast and drinks were good, I had the guava mojito. I got the chicken empanada appetizer and they were really good. Then I got the beef stew with rice and it was cool, ofc i prefer a little more seasoning to my stew but it wasnt bad, just a little more seasoning"
69,3,"An extremely mediocre Cuban restaurant. I came here to celebrate a birthday and we were given the entire back room to ourselves. Very spacious, the room was extremely dark. Also, because there were about 20 of us, we had to sit at 2 different tables which made it difficult to socialize. I was very disappointed in the vaca frita. I kept squeezing lime on it in hopes that it would give it more juice but I was wrong. The vaca frita was extremely dry and overcooked. When I learned how much my portion cost (including gratuity) I honestly could not believe it. To me, my meal was worth no more than $15. A friend of mine raves about this place, but I beg to differ. There are Cuban restaurants with better food and better prices not far from this one. I would recommend one of those before recommending this restaurant to anyone."
70,4,"I have been here a few times over the years.  Solid, legit food and a nice atmosphere.  Dine outside, take in the street scene, and enjoy a great dinner.  :)"
71,4,"The Cuban was great! My boyfriend easily got a table outside on a weekend afternoon. We shared the chicken empanadas to start, and the ropa vieja as our entree. (Wasn't the best ropa vieja I've ever had, but it was solid.) Tres leches cake for dessert was the highlight!"
72,5,Awesome!! I've been wanting to try this place put for a while and finally decided to do so. My friend and came here without reservations but was greeted and seated immediately. This a late review but I saved the pictures. Everything we ordered was delicious and the service was fast and professional. Will definitely be back!!
73,5,"This place is amazing, we were just strolling around Hoboken and we ran into this place we ordered the steak mussels and Cuban sandwich. and wow it was delicious with amazing service! I would definitely go back they also have happy hour"
74,2,"Went back to the Cuban first time in couple of years.  I assume the management has changed.  The drinks, food, service all were nowhere near what I experienced before.  The white wine sangria typically is full of fruits and colorful.  This was white, tasted like watered-down wine.  El Classico came with white rice instead of morro rice.  When I asked, they said they ran out of morro rice.  There was no yuca bread to the table either. It was only 8:30 PM Saturday night and they were already out of some items?This used to be one of my favorite places in Hobokon.  Not anymore."
75,2,The food was okay. Went for my boyfriends birthday and cake they gave us seemed very old and dry and it was definitely overpriced. There were also 4 of us and they put  us in table too small and only let us move to something more comfortable if we ordered an appetizer
76,4,"Did outdoor dining here in early fall and everything we had tasted really good! We ordered a whole bunch of appetizers plus a paella and although busy, we had good service and enjoyed our experience."
77,5,"The Cuban Restaurant and Bar is the perfect Cuban restaurant. On a Saturday evening with a crowd of ten, my family and I were not only blown away by the amazing service,but also the delicious authentic Cuban food. If you have ever been to the area, you know how packed Hoboken can get on a Saturday night. Although it was a packed house, our waiters did an amazing job making sure that everything was on point. Fast and efficient service all throughout the night.Our meals were perfect all around. I ordered the churrasco with rice and a side salad and WOW was I blown away not only with the portion size, but the authenticity and flavor. Grilled skirt steak, Cuban yuca fries, watercress salad, chimichurri, cuban rice.DELICIOUS. The drinks are equally as good. Mojitos, sangria and piña coladas were ordered."
78,5,My wife and kids swear the churrasco with yucca fries is amazing. I had the vegetable paella and I loved it. Zesty flavor!  Their rice and black beans is yummy. For apps we shared the shrimp with garlic sauce. We sopped up the sauce with Cuban bread. We also shared the empanadas with spinach and Manchego cheese.  So delicious. Crispy crust with a moist filling.   We skipped dessert we were so full. Definitely coming back here.
79,5,"The Cuban is easily my favorite restaurant in Hoboken.There are a number of similar places between Jersey City, Hoboken, and Weehawken, but The Cuban tops them all.Happy Hour. To start your night the proper way, the happy hour menu has a laundry list of things that are $5. No, not just a few beers and some well drinks; legitimately their entire (or close to it) drink menu has everything priced at $5. Tonight I had the cuban version of a long island iced tea, which is just as strong as you'd think. Served with a thimble-sized about of coke in it, i'm pretty sure it was 98% alcohol. I also had a $5 mojito at 6:59pm (happy hour ends at 7, but on Mondays, classic mojitos are $5 all night) and a red sangria towards the end of dinner.On a mojito scale of 1-10, these come in at a solid 8. Not too sweet, nice and minty, and plenty strong. Any of the flavored ones will add some extra sugar, so if you want to go that route, the mango mojito is a great choice.Now that you're basically almost drunk, grab your table and put in a few apps. The guac is really good - not as good as the classic version you'd get in a Mexican restaurant, but the crabmeat on top is excellent and the plantain chips add just a little bit of extra salt, which works well. I would also recommend the tamal en hoja, camarones al ajillo, and empanaditas. Order another mojito, and thank your waiter or waitress feverishly for bringing over the rolls and butter to help soak up some of your happy hour. The rolls are tiny, but don't let that fool you, they are so dense and chewy (and delicious) that you need to be careful not to fill up on them before your main dish comes......Because now it's time for...EL CLASSICO. Every time I come here, I get it. Every time I come here, I say, ehhh, i'll get something different, broaden my horizons. Every time I come here, I pick something else. Every time I come here, I can't help but order El Classico. The pork falls off the bone, the yucca is swimming in garlic, the moro rice is one of my favorites, and the plantains are the sweetness that helps create that perfect bite. I love anything pickled, and while they are a very small part of the dish, the pickled red onions add the perfect amount of acidity to balance the whole dish out. Even thought I always get that, I have tasted other things -- the churrasco, the oxtail, bronzino, and ropa vieja. Everything is always excellent, so get whatever sounds good to you. But given I wrote a giant paragraph about it, consider El Classico if it at all appeals. Dessert? Bread pudding and churros. The BP is just the right amount of chocolatey without being overbearing, and the churros...stuffed with chocolate...yeah I don't have to say much more than that. The only slightly not five star thing is the reservation system - they aren't on OpenTable and you need to request a reservation online (or...gasp...call them), but those requests are generally confirmed the same day, so it's not a big deal."
80,1,Horrible service.  1/2 my table ordered steaks and we were forced to cut with butter knives but the table next to us got steak knifes.  When I complained they said oh well..  then they charged a 20% tip.   Will not be going back.   Avoid this place.   Better places not in Hoboken.
81,5,"First, visit here and we will be back. We were seated right away and our server was awesome throughout our meal. No drink was ever empty. It was a fabulous dinner! This restaurant checks all the boxes, great food, impeccable service, and a very nice atmosphere.The Tres Leches were pure bliss! The Vaca frita Plato was cooked perfectly and was exquisite. The service was excellent, not obtrusive but very attentive. Water was constantly refilled and the fact that the wait staff folds the napkin when a guest heads to the bathroom is a nice touch."
82,1,"So I used to like this place. They still have some awesome mojitos but nothing is worst than bad customer service. I believe we encountered the manager when we walked in who was very unwelcoming.  He kept staring at us the whole time as if waiting to see what or how much we will order. My friend asked for the happy hour menu, then we over hear our waitress telling the manager in Spanish "" they are here for happy hour"". I don't see why that would be a problem especially if that is part of your menu at that time. Something I wanted was from the regular menu and our waitress made sure to remind me that it wasn't part of happy hour. I had to tell her that I'm aware of that and still would like to order it. We felt judged the entire time we were there. Next I ordered a guava mojito. Waitress says to me that she is surprised I ordered the guava flavor because most people don't know what guava is. Then asked me how is it that I am familiar with guava. I returned the question to her and asked her how is she familiar with that flavor. She then says she is from a tropical country and i let her know that I too am from a tropical country and very familiar with guava. . Sorry but Hispanics are not the only ones from tropical countries. I don't like ignorance. I don't care how good drinks or food is. Imagine going to a place for a good time and the entire staff is staring at you the whole time. Like I said drinks are good here but service might not be if management and the employees don't take a liking to you or prejudge you. You may be made to feel uncomfortable."
83,5,We were looking for a spot to celebrate my husband's birthday. We came across this Cuban restaurant and I'm so glad we decided to give it a try. The food was simply amazing. Our server was super sweet and friendly. Shout out to our server who moved out to Hoboken from Queens New York. I apologize I didn't get your name. You made our night and thank you for your excellent customer service. We tried various dishes but the pictures I posted were our favorites. Everything was super delicious and super tender. The Mojito's and Modelo especial we're just what we needed. I love the interior of the restaurant. However you need to make reservations for indoor dining. I would highly recommend that especially with how unpredictable the weather can be. The outside patio was just right for us and on perfect timing since it started to rain once we were about to leave. There is plenty of seating. The restrooms are on the third floor. Everything was very clean and delightful. But when it comes to parking I'm not really sure since we walked here. Come check this place out for yourself and see how delicious this food is. If I'm ever in the area I will definitely come back.
84,5,It's one of my favorite restaurants in Hoboken. I have been there many time since I moved to the area. I've ordered most of the items on the menu and it never disappoints. Outdoor seatings also very nice. Pic is from the most recent visit with new friends in town. I ordered the paella. It's the wet version. Taste good. Big portion. I suggest order for 2.
85,1,"This restaurant was a huge disappointment to say the least. The ambiance and food presentation definitely looks better in Yelp pictures than it does in person. We came here to celebrate my wife's birthday and were disappointed in every sense. This is easily among the worst dining experiences we've ever had. We knew it was bad when our server didn't seem to have an in-depth knowledge of the menu or drink specials on offer. The coconut mojitos that we both ordered were overly sweet. My wife ordered the fish of the day- grouper with mango salsa. She stated it was only just edible without much in the way of flavor. Our server stated that it was served over mofongo, but I've had mofongo before and this was not it. It was just a burnt potato-like concoction. My pork shank was somehow fatty and dry at the same time. It was very difficult to finish as I kept going back to my glass of water to get down each bite. The black bean rice was inedible, although the plantains were okay I suppose. Yay, I guess?I would not recommend this restaurant. I'm not sure where all of the high ratings are coming from. Also, what is with Yelp indicating that this place is trendy and classy? I saw a guy walk in with a T-shirt and gym shorts."
86,2,"I'm very disappointed to give this restaurant two stars because I've been a valued customer for years. Every time I'm in town from California I literally always try to plan a trip to come eat here. However, I'd have to say that my husband and I did not feel very welcome with the new I'll-mannered and discourteous hostess that is now working here. So much so, that we were out the door before we even got to our seat. I don't think I've ever felt so unwelcome at a restaurant and for that reason I don't think I'll ever be coming back."
87,5,"Amazing restaurant! I came here for my birthday in the beginning of March with my family. Staff was extremely friendly and the food was delicious. From the sangria, to appetizers, to meal, to dessert, I can't wait to visit again. The empanadas were amazing for appetizers; we got beef, chicken, and spinach and cheese. The spinach and cheese were surprisingly my favorite. For the meal I got a combo that came with potatoes, spinach, steak, and shrimp. I really enjoyed everything. Thanks for a great dinner!"
88,1,Not good. We didn't like it. It was Dissapointing. We won't recommend it. The food wasn't tasteful.
89,1,Took over 1.5 hours to get our food. Cute ambiance but would not come back due to the long wait times &amp; waiters not paying any attention to your table.
90,5,"Time and time again this place just nails it. We had the crispy beef, empanadas and churros for dessert. Always great service as well. Thank you for being so on top of it all the time."
91,5,Sandra was our hostess and she was so nice Thanks to her we got to sit outside because at first one guy told us was too late to sit outside (was only 10:20 pm) And she gladly took over and was more kind. She recommended us good food rabo guisado and was sooooo good! I had a great time thanks to her and I'll definitely will come back!!!
